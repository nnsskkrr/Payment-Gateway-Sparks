  Women hold our worlds together in a million ways as a mother, a sister, a daughter,
  a homemaker, a teacher, a doctor, and a leader. A girl child enters the world with 
  the same hopes, dreams, and aspirations as a boy, but she quickly discovers that fulfilling 
  them is far more difficult. The lack of an education and the numerous regulations that a 
  girl is required to follow in order to conform to societal norms causes her to suffer 
  psychologically, emotionally, and physically from an early age.
  Educate, equip, and empower girl children with great education, right nutrition, 
  good health, appropriate skills, and, most importantly, a high level of self-confidence 
  to help them live their life to their best potential.
